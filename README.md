# Almost Free Launch Clamps (ALFC)

Recently, I have heard a few people grumbling about how launch clamps add to your total mass and cost of your vessel in the VAB, sometimes resulting in not having enough funds, or being overweight. "Their mass ony equals 0.1, so how can it make you overwieght?" I've seent it! Dont question me. After discussing with many experts, colleagues and kerbals, we have come to the conclusion that launch clamps should be free and not count toward your total mass or launch costs. ALFC makes launch clamps free. Kinda. Its up to how you play really. If you play with **"entry purchases required"**, you will only pay the entry fee. Guys old enough to go to the club should be used to this by now. Entry prices have been raised to balance out the "free" effect with this mod. If you don't play with "entry purchases" It's free. ALWAYS. Pretty lame. Its not hard to imagine that the launch clamps are reusable, and should technically be a part of the launch pad. We shouldn't have to continuously pay for a new set each time we launch! 

# Functionality:
Launch clamps capable of transfering fuel to the vessel can do so on the launch pad. right click on the clamp and select "Fuel On" to begin fueling your vessel. 

_This can be considered cheaty, but I'll tell you anyway. Draining the tanks in the VAB results in huge launch cost savings and fueling up on the launch pad is free, but its immersive in the fact that you have to sit and wait for you tanks to fill up._

# This mod is compatible with:
* Stock launch clamps (duh)
* FASA Launch Clamps
* Bluedog Design Bureau
* SpaceY Lifters Pack
* Community Resource Pack

_If there are others that you want patched, you will have to let me know_
